# PythonPDFExtractor

Technical Skills: Python, GitHub and MS Office.
Description: Project assigned by Professor Wayne Brown from the "Automated Documentation using Python" course to be a team leader and solve a problem for a client assigned by the college. The aim of this project was to automate manual and routine processes. The project consisted of creating a program that could create a new pdf document based on individual pages and/or page ranges from another source PDF document. We mainly used the Python language PyPDF2, os and re modules for the source code; the GUI was designed using the tkinter module as a design tool and we created the executor so that the client could use the program efficiently on her computer. 

Teamwork was done using branches on GitHub, frequent team online meetings where we discussed how to develop the best way to create efficient code and also meetings with the client to show the weekly progress.

Result of project: Customer satisfaction and reference letter from the client and Professor Brown.
